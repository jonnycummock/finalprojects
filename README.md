# Final Projects

I wasn't able to attach the image of the completed heatmap, however I believe the code should work just fine on someone else's computer. Either the file was too large (RStudio didn't want it, but I did a work around to get my file in there), or my computer couldn't process it, because every time I tried to generate the heatmap, RStudio would freeze up, seize up my laptop, and all of a sudden my computer would have 0KB of free space and die. I'll send you an email as well. Thanks!
